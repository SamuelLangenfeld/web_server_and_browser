This was a project from the curriculum of the Odin Project
A Real Web Server and Browser (from the command line) http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/ruby-on-the-web

The goal of the project was to set up a simple server from your command line that could accept post and get requests for files. The client uploads a hash that is converted to a json object and then parsed by the server. The server takes the information and uses it to help write a new html file.

When I started this project I knew absolutely nothing about sockets, json, or the basics of how servers and clients communicated. This project is very basic but it was extremely educational.
